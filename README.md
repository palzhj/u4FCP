# u4FCP & uRTM v2

## Introduction

MicroTCA.4 Fast Control and Process board (u4FCP) is an FPGA-based [MicroTCA.4](https://www.picmg.org/product/microtca-enhancements-rear-io-precision-timing-specification/) compatible Advanced Mezzanine Card (AMC) targeting generic clock, control and data acquisition in High-Energy Physics(HEP) experiments. 


MicroTCA.4 Rear Transition Module (uRTM) is a rear transition module in the rear of the crate to increase the I/O capability of the u4FCP. The u4FCP and uRTM are connected through fabric connectors in the upper area above the standard ÂµTCA backplane area, defined as Zone 3. The pin assignment is compatible with the [Zone 3 recommendation](https://techlab.desy.de/resources/zone_3_recommendation/index_eng.html) D1.4 for digital applications.


u4FCP & uRTM are conceived to serve a midsized system residing either inside a MicroTCA crate or stand-alone on desktop with high-speed optical links or ethernet to PC.

The I/O capability of u4FCP & uRTM can be further enhanced with four [VITA-57.1 FPGA Mezzanine Cards (FMC)](https://ohwr.org/projects/fmc-projects/wiki/fmc-standard) through the high-pin-count sockets. 

## Block Diagram

A block diagram of the u4FCP and uRTM is shown below. The red lines are high-speed serial links connceted to the [gigabyte transceivers (GTY/GTH/GTX)](https://docs.xilinx.com/r/en-US/ug440-xilinx-power-estimator/Using-the-Transceiver-Sheets-GTP-GTX-GTH-GTY-GTZ) of the FPGA. The blue lines are the general input/outputs connected to the High Performance(HP), High Range(HR) or High Density(HD) banks of the FPGA.

### clock Features

Based on cross-point switches and programmable clock multipliers, the clock distribution for u4FCP and uRTM offer a large selection of input clock sources (e.g. the LEMO connectors in the front/rear panel, the AMC clocks, the FMC clocks, or onboard oscillators). This makes the u4FCP & uRTM give users the possibility of implementing various high speed serial data protocols for custom applications.
