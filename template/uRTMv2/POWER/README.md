# FMC Power Setup

FMC power is controlled and monitored by UCD90124A. UCD's threshold can be adjusted by software. It can report over current warning and fault to host. In addition, E-fuse is used for over current protection by hardware. The tables below show the default setup. Once the software/hardware fault happened, you need to re-power the board to re-start.
